Display the social sharing counts of your blog posts in the WordPress Admin dashboard.

== Description ==

The Social Sharing plugin will display the the social sharing counts of your blog posts in the WordPress Admin dashboard. It adds a new column to your Edit Posts screen where these numbers are displayed.

The statistics are pulled live from Twitter, Facebook, Google Plus and other social networks. You can also tweet, like or +1 your blog posts from the WordPress admin dashboard itself.

If you would like to hide the Social Sharing Stats column in WordPress, either choose Screen Options and uncheck the Social column or deactivate the plugin itself.

The plugin uses JavaScript to display the social sharing counts and does not make any changes to your WordPress database or blog posts. For best performance, display 10-20 posts per WordPress screenshot.
