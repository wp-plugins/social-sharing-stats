== Description ==

This WordPress plugin will display the the social sharing counts of your blog posts in the WordPress Admin dashboard. It adds a new column to your "Edit Posts" screen where the counts are displayed.

The sharing statistics are pulled from Twitter, Facebook, Google Plus and other social networks. You can also tweet, like or +1 your blog posts from the WordPress admin dashboard itself.

The plugin uses JavaScript to display the social sharing counts and does not store any data in your WordPress database or blog posts.
